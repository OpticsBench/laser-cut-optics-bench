#Lasercut Optics Bench

Simple optics holders from common hardware and pieces cut on a laser cutter.

##About the optics bench

If you want to do optics experiments, you'll need a way to hold the components. Commercial optical holders tend to be expensive.

This project describes a set of simple optics holders that you can make from common hardware and pieces cut using your laser cutter.

Sources are DXF files that you can import and cut with most laser software.

Although inexpensive, the system can make variety of interesting and subtle optical setups, such as:

* Measure the focal length of a lens
* Project an image on a screen
* A simple telescope
* A simple microscope
* Design and development of lens systems
* A Michelson Interferometer
